Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary
:
Duration: May 5, 2024, 14:00 UTC to May 6, 2024, 03:00 UTC

Impact: Our e-commerce platform took an unscheduled siesta, leaving 75% of our users window-shopping in frustration
.
Root Cause: Our load balancer decided it needed a break, leaving our servers high and dry under the weight of unexpected traffic.

Timeline:
May 5, 2024, 14:00 UTC: Our monitoring dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree with error notifications.
14:05 UTC: The engineering team received an emergency wake-up call from our automated monitoring system.
14:15 UTC: We initially suspected a database rebellion due to recent schema changes.
15:30 UTC: After a fruitless quest for database demons, we turned our attention to the load balancer.
17:00 UTC: We briefly entertained the idea of a DDoS attack, but it turned out our users were just really, really eager to shop.
19:00 UTC: With our patience wearing thin and our caffeine levels dangerously low, we called in the cavalry – senior engineering management.
21:30 UTC: Load balancer logs revealed it was simply overwhelmed by our popularity.
May 6, 2024, 02:00 UTC: We gave our load balancer a pep talk and adjusted its settings to handle the fame.
03:00 UTC: Service resumed, and our platform came back to life.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: Our load balancer couldn’t handle the spotlight and choked on the influx of users.
Resolution: We boosted the load balancer's confidence with some configuration tweaks and promised it more breaks in between traffic surges.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Teach our load balancer some stress management techniques – maybe a little yoga?
Implement automated scaling to give our load balancer a helping hand during traffic jams.
Invest in some virtual bouncers to keep out unwanted traffic without crashing the party.
Schedule regular load tests to ensure our platform can handle the paparazzi without breaking a sweat.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Update load balancer settings to prevent future diva moments.
Deploy automated scaling policies to handle unexpected popularity spikes.
Train our monitoring system to distinguish between adoring fans and pesky troublemakers.
Host a team-wide brainstorming session on creative ways to keep our load balancer happy and healthy.
Celebrate our successful revival with a round of virtual high-fives and a well-deserved nap for the engineering team.
By taking these measures and pampering our load balancer with the attention it deserves, we’ll ensure smoother sailing for our e-commerce platform and keep our users happily clicking away without any more unexpected downtime.
